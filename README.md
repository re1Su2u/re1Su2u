I am yurindo. Beginner developer.
---

I don't know how usual programmers write the code. That means there's no theory of programming in my mind. Thus, my code is written terribly. If a sophisticated programmer see my code, s/he will screem and run.. 

Of course, I keep in mind to write readable codes when developing. However, the way I try to implement things can be incorrect because I am beginner as I wrote. If so, please teach me how to fix it. It makes me a better developer.
